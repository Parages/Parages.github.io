<p>
    I am very sensitive to climate change, and this weather forecast-like professional thinking permeates my response to the tiny world around me. Leaving the subtropical <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project6')">south</span>, when the winter in southeast Asia, accompanied by the penetrating moisture of the Yangtze River, blocks a city that slowly falls like resin, a method link built on premonition and masonry engineering appears in the scope of writing. This is when <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project1')">Parages</span> appears, a feeling and construction of unpredictable cartography, the sea continues to extend to the end of the limit. Fortunately, with the thinking and help of tools, we can perceive this extremely complex and huge <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project7')">system</span> with <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project8')">friends</span>. There are disappointing <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project3')">silent resources</span> here, and there is also a <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project11')">society</span> of one person. Because of this, transparent society is a methodology, how to see me? In the sunny day that is coming soon, we can hide in the shadow of  <span onclick="drawLine(this, 'project2')">urban heritage</span> and build an alternative world.
