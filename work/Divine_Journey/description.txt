The design of "Divine Journey" refers to the traditional Shoujin paper design of southern Fujian, using woodblock prints to merge the geopolitics with the experience of gods and spirits, and through the coarse process of bare ridge binding threads, it presents in zine a scene of the divine journey of humans and gods living together in the land of Fujian.

Designed by Liu Chang. Photoed by Peng Jing.

The Divine Journey has been exhibited at Offprint London Art Book Fair, Hong Kong Art Book Fair, Bangkok Art Book Fair, Thailand, and the Independent Bookstore Reading Festival.
