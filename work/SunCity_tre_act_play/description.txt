Sun City Three-Act-play is an experimental soundscape and spatial transformation initiative in Nanjing's informal music venues. Through the planning and design of participatory activities, it aims to change the social status quo of Nanjing, where there is a lack of interactive spaces. By organizing creators within the community to work together to rewrite spatial narratives using transmedia and other technological techniques, we are able to discuss the potential for occupation, diffusion, propagation, and self-governance between citizen and place in a Fluxus and interventionist way.
