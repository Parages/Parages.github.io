Design [v.] Library | The Metaphysics of Notation’ Graphic Score Performance
Artist Mark Applebaum installed a strange, complex, and elaborate 70-foot-tall behemoth "The Metaphysics of Notation" at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University. This is a graphic music score that consists of detailed pictures and texts but does not contain any instructions for itself. It exists as a hanging piece of sheet music. Every Friday from noon to 1 pm, different types of performers will play this music score according to their own rules and methods. 

Based on the principle of spatial self-organization, I organized this unreported performance in the school library. Due to the epidemic, the performance was stopped after 3 minutes.
